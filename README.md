# Fractal-Wind-Energy-System
This project represents a novel approach to renewable energy, inspired by fundamental principles of energy oscillations and resonance. By developing this prototype, we aim to validate the feasibility of a vibration and resonance-based wind energy system, opening new doors for sustainable energy solutions.
